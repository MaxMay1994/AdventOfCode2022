# Advent Of Code 2022

Advent of Code is a programming challenge where you can solve puzzles on a daily bases. 
This year I will challenge myself and try to solve the puzzles using Kotlin.
This will be the first time I'm using Kotlin and I'm very excited.

I will work irregular on the challenge and hoppfully finish before next year :D

Happy Coding!!!
